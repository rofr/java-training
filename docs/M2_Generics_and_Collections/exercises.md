# Exercises M2

## 1. Replace arrays with collections
- Copy the geometry demo class to a new class, GeometryCollectionsDemo, and use a collection of your choice instead of an array to store the shapes.
- Create a random number of shapes instead of a fixed

## 2. Sorting and comparison
- Examine and run the class geometry.ComparisonDemo
- The last line of code does not compile. Why?
- Fix the problem in 2 different ways

## 3. Use alternative data structure for Shapes (optional)
- Create a copy of the GeometryDemo class
- Assign each shape a unique id by adding a field and getter
- Store the shapes in a map using the id as key and the Shape itself as value, so use a Map<Integer, Shape>
- When displaying shapes, display them in ascending order by id
