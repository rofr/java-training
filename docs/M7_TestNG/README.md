# Module 7 - Automated test using TestNG

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

* Annotations.
* Test that your code is multithread safe.
* Flexible test configuration.
* Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
* Support for parameters.
* Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
